Details About WorldVisitz
Background
WorldVisitz is a travel agency. WorldVisitz has engaged you as an agile consultant and coach to launch their mobile application solution. This solution will allow customers to book travel with all major airlines. The mobile application will leverage predictive analytics to try and upsell additional travel-related services and offerings.

The executives have advised you they are concerned that the current detailed requirements and specifications document has an 18 months’ estimate for project delivery. They have heard that an Agile approach might help WorldVisitz monetize offerings sooner incrementally.

Additional Details
You had an important meeting with the executives and Product Manager. The executives have shared the following details:

In order to launch, WorldVisitz needs to make flights available to purchase from all major airlines. There needs to be a search functionality that allows for a search with the following criteria: dates, one-way/round-trip/multi-city, number of passengers, ages, and number of stops.
Travelers must be able to utilize any major credit card to purchase
Business Intelligence capabilities in the background should recommend upselling opportunities from partner offerings.
WorldVisitz must integrate with services provided by HotelzMotelz, AutoRentalz, Insurancez, and TravelPackagez
 Your Task
WorldVisitz executives want you to define an Agile delivery solution to replace their current inefficient traditional product development processes.

The executives are concerned about the current lack of knowledge transfer between team members, as well as not adhering to coding standards. They have also been hearing of a lack of trust and camaraderie between the offshore and onshore resources.

Based on your assessment of the above scenario, you are to proceed with recommending the optimal framework. You will need to help the team launch the appropriate information radiators, ceremonies, as well as assign agile roles to team members.


Timeline
The executives have indicated they strongly prefer some predictable development process where they can get iterative working features that they can launch as and when the business sees fit. They are concerned with the lack of effective knowledge transfer and weak coding standards in the development team. Team members are not co-located, which makes knowledge transfer challenging.


Team
You have been introduced to the following team members:

Icon/Name	Current Title	Current Work Style
Jane Doe	Project Manager	Jane manages the team by focusing on the scope to be delivered, planning the work out primarily herself and assigning work to individuals based on her preference
John Smith	Product Manager	John likes to conduct extensive market research and product planning upfront; he is detached from the developers by process, department, and facility boundaries
Jim Brady (USA)
Nathan Connor (USA)
Venkat Ragu (India)
Ali Khan (India)	Developers (2 Onshore, 2 Offshore)	The offshore developers are contractors who have more senior technical expertise; they are individually assigned the more complex project deliverables by the Project Manager. The less complex deliverables are individually assigned to the onshore developers by the Project Manager. There is no process to transfer knowledge from the offshore contractors to the onshore developers. There’s a lack of consistent coding standards.
Kathy Qualls	Tester	Kathy steps into the process lifecycle once the code has been developed thoroughly. She likes to go through testing and provide full feedback to the Project Manager once she completes her testing cycle
Jerry Holden	Business Analyst	Jerry conducts upfront business analysis and product definition; requirements are detailed and frozen early on so a detailed project plan can be followed
James Cowx	UX Designer	James builds out UX based on specifications and requirements in the Project Plan created by the Project Manager and Business Analyst. Customer feedback is received late, in market testing and after product launch.
Holly Vogt	Subject Matter Expert	Holly prefers one-on-one interviews and calls with the Project Manager and Business Analyst to provide expert opinion and guidance.
